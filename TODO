before 1.0.0:
 -) randomly choose dns servers instead of static /etc/resolv.conf
 -) include tor fast gateway scripts

sometime:
-) rewrite build script
-) make circuit length configureable to 2 or 3 in tor fast gateway

maybe:
-) exclude tor nodes with certain country information (not same country as origin?) - ExcludeNodes {??} # for nodes without information - see https://www.maxmind.com/app/iso3166 for others.
